(1) The overall design of the code is to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models for the Kaggle competition on stroke prediction. The code starts by loading the necessary libraries and setting up the notebook configuration. Then, it reads the input datasets and performs some data preprocessing steps such as filling missing values using KNN, merging datasets, and separating features. After that, it trains a Lasso Regression model using cross-validation and evaluates its performance. Next, it trains XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost models using stratified k-fold cross-validation and evaluates their performance. Finally, it blends the predictions from all the models and generates the final submission file.

(5) The advanced machine learning techniques used in this code are:

- Lasso Regression: Lasso Regression is a linear regression model with L1 regularization. It is used to select the most important features and perform feature selection.

- XGBoost: XGBoost is a gradient boosting model that uses decision trees as base learners. It is an advanced ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak models to create a strong predictive model.

- LightGBM: LightGBM is another gradient boosting model that uses decision trees as base learners. It is designed to be efficient and scalable, making it suitable for large datasets.

- CatBoost: CatBoost is a gradient boosting model that uses decision trees as base learners. It is designed to handle categorical features efficiently and has built-in support for handling missing values.

(6) Some important tricks that play a role in achieving high performance in this code are:

- Filling missing values using KNN: The code uses K-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression to fill missing values in the 'bmi' feature. This helps to ensure that the dataset is complete and ready for training.

- Label encoding and standard scaling: The code uses label encoding to convert categorical features into numerical representations. It also uses standard scaling to normalize the numerical features. These preprocessing steps help to ensure that the features are in a suitable range for training the models.

- Cross-validation: The code uses cross-validation techniques (repeated k-fold and stratified k-fold) to evaluate the performance of the models. This helps to estimate the model's performance on unseen data and avoid overfitting.

- Blending predictions: The code blends the predictions from multiple models (Lasso Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost) to create a final prediction. This ensemble technique helps to improve the overall performance by combining the strengths of different models.

- Hyperparameter tuning: The code sets the hyperparameters for each model based on prior knowledge and experimentation. Fine-tuning the hyperparameters can significantly improve the model's performance.

- Feature selection: The code uses Lasso Regression to perform feature selection and select the most important features for training the models. This helps to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and improve the model's performance.
