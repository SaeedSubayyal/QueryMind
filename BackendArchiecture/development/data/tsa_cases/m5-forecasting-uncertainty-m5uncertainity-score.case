(1) The overall design of this code is to train a model for a Kaggle competition on sales forecasting. It preprocesses the sales and calendar data, creates features, splits the data into training, validation, and test sets, builds a neural network model, trains the model, and makes predictions.

(2) The overall model architecture is a neural network with multiple inputs and outputs. The inputs include categorical variables such as "snap_CA", "snap_TX", "snap_WI", "wday", "month", "year", "event", "nday", "item", "dept", "cat", "store", "state", and numerical variables such as "num". The categorical variables are embedded using embedding layers, and the embeddings are concatenated with the numerical variables. The concatenated features are then passed through multiple dense layers with dropout regularization. The output layer has 9 units, corresponding to the 9 quantiles to be predicted. The model is trained using the quantile loss function.

(3) The important hyperparameters in this code are:
- CATEGORIZE: A boolean variable indicating whether to categorize the categorical variables or not.
- START: An integer indicating the starting day for the training data.
- UPPER: An integer indicating the upper limit of the days to be included in the dataset.
- LAGS: A list of integers indicating the lag values to be used as features.
- FEATS: A list of strings indicating the names of the lag features.
- batch_size: An integer indicating the batch size for training the model.
- epochs: An integer indicating the number of epochs for training the model.

(4) The optimization objective is to minimize the quantile loss function, which is a pinball loss for multiple quantiles. The quantiles used are [0.005, 0.025, 0.165, 0.250, 0.500, 0.750, 0.835, 0.975, 0.995].

(5) The advanced machine learning technique used in this code is the use of a neural network with multiple inputs and outputs. The model architecture includes embedding layers for categorical variables, concatenation of embeddings with numerical variables, and multiple dense layers with dropout regularization.

(6) Some important tricks that play a role in high performance are:
- Categorizing the categorical variables to reduce memory usage and improve model performance.
- Preprocessing the sales and calendar data to generate lag features.
- Using embedding layers for categorical variables to capture their non-linear relationships with the target variable.
- Using dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.
- Using the quantile loss function to train the model for multiple quantiles simultaneously.
- Using early stopping and learning rate reduction callbacks to prevent overfitting and improve convergence.
