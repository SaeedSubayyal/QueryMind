(1) The overall design of this code is to build a model for a Kaggle competition on sales forecasting. It preprocesses the sales and calendar data, creates features, and trains a model using a combination of numerical and categorical inputs.

(2) The overall model architecture consists of an embedding layer for categorical features, followed by a concatenation of the embeddings with the numerical features. This concatenated input is then passed through three GRU layers with dropout, and finally a dense layer with 9 outputs corresponding to the quantiles of the sales forecast.

(3) The important hyperparameters in this code are:
- CATEGORIZE: a boolean flag indicating whether to categorize the categorical features or not.
- START: the starting day of the sales data to consider.
- UPPER: the upper limit of the days to consider in the sales data.
- LAGS: a list of lag values to use for creating lagged features.
- seq_len: the length of the input sequence for the GRU layers.
- batch_size: the batch size for training the model.
- epochs: the number of epochs for training the model.
- learning_rate: the learning rate for the optimizer.

(4) The optimization objective is to minimize the weighted quantile loss, which is a pinball loss for multiple quantiles. The quantiles used are [0.005, 0.025, 0.165, 0.250, 0.500, 0.750, 0.835, 0.975, 0.995].

(5) The advanced machine learning technique used in this code is the GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) layer, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) layer. The GRU layer is used to capture the temporal dependencies in the sales data.

(6) Some important tricks that play a role in achieving high performance include:
- Lagged features: The code creates lagged features of the sales data using the specified lag values. These lagged features capture the historical patterns in the sales data.
- Embedding layers: The categorical features are converted into embeddings using embedding layers. This allows the model to learn meaningful representations of the categorical variables.
- Dropout: Dropout is applied to the GRU layers to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
- Weighted quantile loss: The quantile loss is weighted by the inverse of the sales volume for each item, which gives more importance to items with higher sales volume.
- Early stopping: The training process is stopped early if the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs, which helps prevent overfitting.
