(1) The overall design of the code is to preprocess and engineer features for time series data in order to improve the performance of a machine learning model for a Kaggle competition.

(2) The overall model architecture is not explicitly mentioned in the code. However, based on the code, it seems that the model architecture is a LightGBM regressor, which is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms.

(3) The important hyper-parameters in this code are not explicitly mentioned. However, based on the code, some possible hyper-parameters that could be set are the number of trees, learning rate, maximum depth of trees, and feature fraction.

(4) The optimization objective is not explicitly mentioned in the code. However, based on the code, the optimization objective could be to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted and actual sales values.

(5) The advanced machine learning technique used in this code is LightGBM, which is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms.

(6) Some important tricks that play a role in high performance in this code are downcasting the data to reduce memory usage, converting the data from wide to long format, introducing lags and rolling/expanding window statistics as features, and mean encoding categorical variables. These tricks help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the machine learning model.
