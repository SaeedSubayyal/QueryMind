(1) The overall design of the code is to train a model for a Kaggle competition on sales forecasting. It preprocesses the sales and calendar data, creates a dataset, defines the model architecture, trains the model, and makes predictions.

(2) The overall model architecture consists of an embedding layer for categorical features, followed by three GRU layers with dropout regularization. The model takes in multiple inputs including categorical features (such as snap_CA, snap_TX, etc.) and numerical features (such as lagged sales values). The categorical features are embedded into lower-dimensional representations, and all the features are concatenated and fed into the GRU layers. The output of the model is a dense layer with 9 units, representing the predicted quantiles of the sales.

(3) The important hyperparameters in this code are:
- CATEGORIZE: A boolean variable indicating whether to categorize the categorical features or not.
- START: An integer indicating the starting day of the sales data to consider.
- UPPER: An integer indicating the upper limit of the days to consider in the sales data.
- LAGS: A list of integers indicating the lag values to use for creating lagged features.
- seq_len: An integer indicating the sequence length of the input data.
- batch_size: An integer indicating the batch size for training the model.
- patience: An integer indicating the number of epochs with no improvement after which training will be stopped.
- min_lr: A float indicating the lower bound of the learning rate during training.

(4) The optimization objective is to minimize the weighted quantile loss (wqloss) function. This loss function calculates the pinball loss for multiple quantiles and weights the losses based on the actual sales values.

(5) The advanced machine learning technique used in this code is the use of a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, specifically the GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) layers. The GRU layers allow the model to capture temporal dependencies in the sales data and make predictions based on the historical sales values.

(6) Some important tricks that play a role in high performance include:
- Categorizing the categorical features: This reduces the dimensionality of the categorical features and allows the model to learn more efficiently.
- Lagged features: Creating lagged features helps the model capture the temporal patterns in the sales data.
- Dropout regularization: Adding dropout regularization to the GRU layers helps prevent overfitting and improves generalization.
- Embedding layers: Using embedding layers for categorical features helps the model learn meaningful representations of the categorical variables.
- Weighted quantile loss: Using a weighted quantile loss function allows the model to focus more on accurately predicting the sales values at specific quantiles, which is important for sales forecasting.
