Sorry for late sharing. First of all, thanks to competition organizers for hosting this interesting competition and my great teammates(@hyd,@rib). And congrats my friend rib for becoming GM.

Our solution is simple, we found information related to "visit_month" very useful and information related to proteins are useless. So we focus on the samples, structures and models.

### Samples
We used samples with visit_month in "[0, 6, 12, 18, 24 , 36, 48, 60, 72, 84]" for training. And found that our cv is much better correlated to LB.

### Features
- All about “visit_month”
1) use visit_month as meta feature
2) gap between visit_month and last visit_month
3) times of visit for each patient
- Little about “protein”
use NPX’s ratio of each patient, instead of the original values

### Structure
1. 16 labels
Predict each “updrs” for predicted_month_diff=0,6,12,24
![](
2. 4 labels
Use predicted_month_diff as a feature, and predict each one’s 4 updrs
![](
### Models
Simple MLP with different structures and parameters.Finally we blends with:
1. Models training in different numbers of labels
2. Models training in different structure of network
3. Models training in different parameters of network
