It combines multiple models and optimizes their performance using a variety of techniques, such as feature importance analysis and hyperparameter tuning.

(6) Some important tricks that play a role in achieving high performance in this code include:
- Feature engineering: Creating new features based on domain knowledge and combining existing features to capture important patterns and relationships in the data.
- Outlier detection: Identifying and flagging outliers in the numerical features to prevent them from affecting the model's performance.
- Feature encoding: Encoding categorical features using techniques such as one-hot encoding and weight of evidence encoding to convert them into numerical representations that can be used by the models.
- Feature selection: Removing non-variance features that do not provide any useful information for the task.
- Scaling: Scaling the numerical features to a similar range to prevent them from dominating the model's learning process.
- Model stacking: Combining the predictions of multiple models, including linear regression, LightGBM, CatBoost, and a neural network, to improve the overall performance.
- Model interpretation: Analyzing the feature importances of the models to gain insights into the important factors influencing the prediction.
- Neural network training: Training a neural network model with multiple hidden layers and regularization techniques, such as dropout and batch normalization, to improve its generalization and prevent overfitting.
