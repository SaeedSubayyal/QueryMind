================================================================================
You are a helpful AI expert assistant, responsible for decision making on the experiment plans. You have the following information including, research problem, research log, and a relevant case so far. 
The research problem is: 
``` Research Problem:
Predict house prices based on the following features: Avg. Area Income, Avg. Area House Age, Avg. Area Number of Rooms, Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms, and Area Population. Use 'Price' as the target variable. Ignore the 'Address' column. Evaluate the model using RMSE.
```
The current research log is:
``` Current Research Log:
Research Problem: Predict house prices based on the following features: Avg. Area Income, Avg. Area House Age, Avg. Area Number of Rooms, Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms, and Area Population. Use 'Price' as the target variable. Ignore the 'Address' column. Evaluate the model using RMSE.

```
Here is a past experience case written by an human expert for a relevant (but not the same) research problem:
``` Case:
(1) The overall design of this code is to train a machine learning model on a dataset and make predictions on a test dataset. The code uses the XGBoost algorithm to build a regression model and predicts the prices of houses based on various features. The training data is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained on the training set. The trained model is then used to make predictions on the test set. The final predictions are combined with another dataset to create the submission file for the Kaggle competition.

(2) The overall model architecture is based on the XGBoost algorithm, which is a gradient boosting framework. XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is an implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm. Gradient boosting is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak models (decision trees in this case) to create a strong predictive model.

In this code, the XGBRegressor class from the xgboost library is used to create the XGBoost model. The model is initialized with the following hyperparameters:
- max_depth: The maximum depth of each tree in the boosting process. It controls the complexity of the model and helps prevent overfitting.
- learning_rate: The learning rate or step size shrinkage used in each boosting iteration. It controls the contribution of each tree to the final prediction.
- n_estimators: The number of boosting iterations or the number of trees in the model.
- objective: The loss function to be minimized during training. In this case, it is set to 'reg:linear' for regression.
- booster: The type of booster to use. It is set to 'gbtree' for tree-based models.

The XGBRegressor model is then trained on the training data using the fit() method. The trained model is used to make predictions on the test data using the predict() method.

(3) The important hyperparameters in this code are set as follows:
- max_depth: 3
- learning_rate: 0.24
- n_estimators: 2000
- objective: 'reg:linear'
- booster: 'gbtree'

These hyperparameters are set based on the specific problem and dataset. The values chosen for these hyperparameters may have been determined through experimentation or tuning to achieve the best performance.

(4) The optimization objective in this code is to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted prices and the actual prices. The XGBoost algorithm uses gradient boosting to iteratively minimize the objective function, which in this case is the MSE.

The mean_squared_error() function from the sklearn.metrics module is used to calculate the MSE between the predicted prices and the actual prices.

(5) The advanced machine learning technique used in this code is gradient boosting with the XGBoost algorithm. Gradient boosting is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak models (decision trees in this case) to create a strong predictive model. XGBoost is an implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm that is known for its efficiency and performance.

(6) Some important tricks that may play a role in achieving high performance in this code include:
- Data preprocessing: The code drops certain columns from the training and test datasets using the drop() method. This may be done to remove irrelevant or redundant features that do not contribute to the prediction task.
- Handling missing values: The code uses the dropna() method to remove rows with missing values from the training dataset. This ensures that the model is trained on complete data and avoids potential issues with missing values during training.
- Train-test split: The code splits the training data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() function from the sklearn.model_selection module. This allows for evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data and helps prevent overfitting.
- Ensemble learning: The code combines the predictions from the XGBoost model with another dataset to create the final submission file. This ensemble approach may help improve the overall performance by leveraging the strengths of multiple models or datasets.
- Hyperparameter tuning: The hyperparameters of the XGBoost model are set based on specific values chosen for max_depth, learning_rate, n_estimators, objective, and booster. These hyperparameters may have been tuned or optimized to achieve the best performance on the given dataset.
```
Follow these instructions and do not forget them:
- Incrementally introduce new techniques in your plans to solve the research problem, since the programmer who follows your decision cannot handle too many instructions at one time.
- Focus on decision making of next single step of experiment. Do not include plans in [Decision] that requires mutiple experiment trials.
- Make sure [Decision] includes all the key points for next step experiment.
- Highlight the supporting experiment results and reasoning before drawing any conclusions.
Make sure that the following prohibitions are not violated:
- Never perform any visualization analysis, since you do not have the ability to view the figures. 
- Never change the way of the dataset split in any way during the experiment.
- Never introduce any new features, unless you have enough knowledge of the features and their meanings.
- Never tune more than two hyper-parameters in one experiment step, since this will lead to computation costs.
- Never introduce any technique for distributed training. We only have one single GPU card.

Received response from model:
================================================================================
[Reflection]:
The research problem is to predict house prices based on given features and evaluate the model using RMSE. Currently, the research log is empty, indicating that no experiments have been conducted yet.

[Reasoning]:
The provided case demonstrates a successful application of the XGBoost algorithm for a similar house price prediction problem. The case highlights the importance of hyperparameter tuning, data preprocessing (handling missing values and dropping irrelevant features), and ensemble learning. We can leverage the insights from this case to guide our initial experiments and improve model performance. Specifically, we can start with an XGBoost model and explore the hyperparameter space, drawing inspiration from the hyperparameters used in the case. We can also implement data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values.

[Thought]:
To begin, I will implement a basic XGBoost model.
1. Load the dataset and split it into training and testing sets.
2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values (if any).
3. Train an XGBoost model with initial hyperparameter values (e.g., those used in the case or default values).
4. Evaluate the model using RMSE on the test set.
5. Log the results.
For the first experiment, I will use the default hyperparameter from XGBoost, and handle the missing values by simply dropping the rows.

[Check]:
The plan involves only one experiment trial. It does not violate any of the prohibitions: it doesn't involve visualization, dataset split modification, new features, tuning more than two hyperparameters, or distributed training.

[Decision]:
Implement a basic XGBoost model with default hyperparameters. Load the dataset, drop rows with missing values, split the data into training and testing sets, train the XGBoost model, evaluate using RMSE, and log the results.
