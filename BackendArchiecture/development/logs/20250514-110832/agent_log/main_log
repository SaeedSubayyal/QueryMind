Step 0:

[Initial State] Lack of a baseline model as a good starting point for the current research problem.

Step 1:
Assistant: 
Action: Develop An Experiment Plan via CBR
Observation:
EnvError: Error executing Develop An Experiment Plan via CBR.
Step 2:
Assistant: 
Action: Execute the Experiment Plan
Observation:
The instruction cannot be perfectly performed by another Python programming Agent in 5 times. Please give a more simplified and feasible instruction and retry.

Step 2:

[Initial State] Lack of a baseline model as a good starting point for the current research problem.

[Experiment Summary]: The attempt to develop an experiment plan using CBR resulted in an error. The instruction given was deemed too complex for the agent to execute within the allowed retries.

[Experiment Result]: No performance improvement was observed as the experiment plan development failed.

Step 3:
