(1) The overall design of the code is to train a high-performing model for a Kaggle competition. It involves loading and preprocessing the data, applying feature engineering techniques, training a LightGBM regressor model, and generating a submission file.

(2) The overall model architecture is as follows:
- The code starts by loading the necessary data files using pandas.
- It then performs some exploratory data analysis and visualization to understand the data.
- The data is then preprocessed and optimized for memory usage using a function called `reduce_mem_usage`.
- Categorical variables are encoded to numerical values using dictionaries to store the categories and their codes.
- Lag features are introduced into the dataset to capture temporal patterns.
- Various combinations of features are created to capture different levels of aggregation and trends.
- Rolling window and expanding window concepts are applied to calculate moving averages and expanding means.
- The data is split into training, validation, and test sets.
- Hyperparameter tuning is performed using the hyperopt library to find the best set of hyperparameters for the LightGBM regressor model.
- The model is trained using the best hyperparameters and predictions are made on the validation and test sets.
- The model is saved using the joblib library.
- Finally, the validation and evaluation results are formatted and saved in a submission file.

(3) The important hyperparameters in this code are tuned using the hyperopt library. The hyperparameters that are tuned include:
- `n_estimators`: The number of boosting iterations.
- `learning_rate`: The learning rate of the boosting process.
- `max_depth`: The maximum depth of the tree.
- `num_leaves`: The maximum number of leaves in a tree.
- `subsample`: The subsample ratio of the training instances.
- `colsample_bytree`: The subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree.
- `min_child_weight`: The minimum sum of instance weight needed in a child.

The hyperparameters are tuned using the `fmin` function from the hyperopt library, which performs a Bayesian optimization search.

(4) The optimization objective is to minimize the root mean squared error (RMSE) between the predicted sales and the actual sales. This is achieved by training the LightGBM regressor model and optimizing the hyperparameters.

(5) The advanced machine learning technique used in this code is the LightGBM regressor model. LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms. It is known for its efficiency, accuracy, and ability to handle large-scale datasets.

(6) Some important tricks that play a role in achieving high performance in this code include:
- Memory optimization: The code uses the `reduce_mem_usage` function to reduce the memory usage of the dataframes, which helps in handling large datasets efficiently.
- Feature engineering: The code creates lag features, combinations of features, and rolling/expanding window features to capture temporal patterns and trends in the data.
- Hyperparameter tuning: The code uses the hyperopt library to perform hyperparameter tuning and find the best set of hyperparameters for the LightGBM model.
- Cross-validation: The code uses cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the model and select the best set of hyperparameters.
- Early stopping: The code uses early stopping in the training process to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance.
- Model serialization: The code saves the trained model using the joblib library, which allows for easy reuse and deployment of the model.
