(1) The overall design of the code is to train a machine learning model using the sales data from a Kaggle competition. The code performs various data preprocessing steps, such as merging different datasets, encoding categorical variables, introducing lag features, and creating rolling and expanding window features. It then uses the LightGBM regressor model to train the data and make predictions. Finally, it generates a submission file for the competition.

(2) The overall model architecture is based on the LightGBM regressor model. The code uses the LightGBMRegressor class from the lightgbm library. The model is trained using the training data and evaluated using the validation data. The model is then used to make predictions on the test data. The model architecture includes various hyperparameters such as the number of estimators, learning rate, maximum depth, number of leaves, subsample ratio, column subsampling ratio, and minimum child weight.

(3) The important hyperparameters in this code are set using the hyperopt library for hyperparameter tuning. The hyperparameters are defined in the valgrid dictionary, which includes the following hyperparameters: n_estimators, learning_rate, max_depth, num_leaves, subsample, colsample_bytree, and min_child_weight. The hyperopt library is used to search for the best combination of hyperparameters by maximizing the cross-validation score.

(4) The optimization objective of this code is to minimize the root mean squared error (RMSE) between the predicted sales values and the actual sales values. The model is trained using the RMSE as the evaluation metric.

(5) The advanced machine learning technique used in this code is the LightGBM regressor model. LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms. It is designed to be efficient and scalable, making it suitable for large-scale datasets. The code uses the LGBMRegressor class from the lightgbm library to train the model.

(6) Some important tricks that play a role in achieving high performance in this code include:
- Data preprocessing: The code performs various data preprocessing steps such as merging datasets, encoding categorical variables, and introducing lag features. These preprocessing steps help to extract meaningful information from the raw data and improve the performance of the model.
- Feature engineering: The code creates rolling and expanding window features, which capture the trend and seasonality in the data. These features provide additional information to the model and help improve its predictive accuracy.
- Hyperparameter tuning: The code uses the hyperopt library to search for the best combination of hyperparameters for the LightGBM regressor model. Hyperparameter tuning helps to optimize the performance of the model and improve its predictive accuracy.
- Memory optimization: The code includes a function called "reduce_mem_usage" that reduces the memory usage of the datasets by converting the data types of the columns to more memory-efficient types. This helps to avoid memory allocation alerts and improves the efficiency of the code.
- Model evaluation: The code uses cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the model. Cross-validation helps to estimate the generalization performance of the model and avoid overfitting.
